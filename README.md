# **Electricity Demand Forecasting using Python**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on analyzing electricity demand data and weather conditions to build a regression model that predicts electricity demand. The pipeline includes:  
✔ Data Loading & Integration  
✔ Data Preprocessing (Cleaning, Feature Engineering)  
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✔ Outlier Detection & Handling  
✔ Regression Modeling & Evaluation  

## **Dataset**  
The dataset consists of raw electricity demand data and weather data in multiple files across two folders. The script automatically scans and merges them into a single cleaned CSV file.  

## **Installation & Requirements**  
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:  

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn rich
```

📂 Electricity-Demand-Forecasting  
 ├── 📂 data/                # Raw electricity & weather data  
 ├── 📂 processed_data/      # Processed and cleaned dataset  
 ├── 📜 electricity_demand_analysis.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook (Full Code)  
 ├── 📜 processed_data.csv   # Final cleaned dataset

```

## **How to Run the Project**  
### **1️⃣ Load & Preprocess Data**  
- Run the `electricity_demand_analysis.ipynb` notebook.  
- The script will scan the data folder, load CSV/JSON files, handle missing values, merge the datasets, and save the cleaned data.  

### **2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- The notebook generates statistical summaries, time-series plots, and correlation heatmaps.  
- It highlights trends, seasonal variations, and outliers.  

### **3️⃣ Regression Modeling**  
- The dataset is split into training/testing sets.  
- A **Linear Regression Model** is built to predict electricity demand.  
- Model performance is evaluated using **MSE, RMSE, and R² Score**.  

### **4️⃣ Results & Output**  
- Final predictions are plotted against actual values.  
- Processed dataset is saved as `processed_data.csv` in the `processed_data/` folder.  

## **Example Commands (For Running in VS Code)**  
- **Run Notebook:** Open `electricity_demand_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.  
- **Run Python Script (if converted to .py):**  
  ```bash
  python electricity_demand_analysis.py
  ```

## **Key Features Implemented**  
✅ Automatic Data Integration & Cleaning  
✅ Feature Engineering (Time-based Features)  
✅ Outlier Detection & Handling  
✅ Time Series Analysis & Visualization  
✅ Regression Model with Evaluation Metrics  

## **Future Improvements**  
🔹 Implement advanced ML models (XGBoost, Random Forest).  
🔹 Incorporate external factors (holidays, economic indicators).  
🔹 Deploy as an interactive dashboard (Streamlit/Flask).
